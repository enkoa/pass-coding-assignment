Project 4

The questions and examples shown in class lecture were helpful, including the drawing picture on the tablet.
TA's answered most of the questions that were troubling/points that were a dilemma.
Most of all, project 3 description and data structure implementation explaination probably helped with this project a lot.
The understanding of project 3 made this one quite easy.

Only website used was the CPlusPlus to remind me what were the parameters for memcpy.
